# Various-Machine-Learning-Assignments
These are assignments from my graduate Machine Learning course. They demonstrate the utility of various regression and classification techniques using real-world data.

### Prerequisites
All of this software was written in the R programming language (version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- "Feather Spray").
A few of the files utilize Tensorflow as well as the R Keras interface to Tensorflow.

### Installing
To install Tensorflow and R Keras, follow these instructions.
1. Install the package 'keras'
2. Load keras with library(keras) and then run install_keras(). (This takes a long time)

After doing this once, you may use the Tensorflow library by calling library(keras). Keras is a simplified interface to Tensorflow; it is a front-end for Tensorflow that makes Tensorflow more user-friendly.
